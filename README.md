<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
Microsoft Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It acts as a centralized database that stores and manages information about network resources, such as users, computers, printers, and groups. AD allows administrators to organize, secure, and control access to these resources through policies and authentication. Users log in once with their credentials to access permitted resources across the network, making it easier to manage large organizations efficiently.<br />
